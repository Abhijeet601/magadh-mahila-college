In an era that facilitates mobility and outreach, it is important to establish cultural exchanges between people of different regions, as a means to further human bonding and a common approach to nation-building. Mutual understanding and trust are the foundations of India's strength and all citizens should feel culturally integrated in all corners of India. The idea of a sustained and structured cultural connect between people of different regions was mooted by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the Rashtriya Ekta Divas held on 31st October, 2015, to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The Prime Minister propounded that cultural diversity is a joy that ought to be celebrated through mutual interaction and reciprocity between people of different States and UTs so that a common spirit of understanding resonates throughout the country. Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat Programme aims to enhance interaction and promote mutual understanding between people of different states/UTs through the concept of state/UT pairing. The states carry out activities to promote a sustained and structured cultural connect in the areas of language learning, culture, traditions, music, tourism, cuisine, sports and sharing of best practices etc.",

Career guidance is provided to the students about various facets of interview techniques. Experts in the field of career counselling are invited to provide guidelines to aspiring job seekers. The college Placement Cell takes the responsibility of placing the students in reputed companies. All willing students are offered Pre-placement training and made employable. When recruiters visit the college for campus placements, the Placement Cell uses this opportunity to find out about the market trends and corporate expectations. Feedback on the performance of our graduates is taken from their employers, so as to assess and address the gaps that need to be filled in order to optimize students' employability. Feedback from the employers also helps in identifying relevant skill and topics to be included in the Pre-placement training sessions. The Cell works, not just with the aim of helping students in each batch secure jobs but also to equip them with industry-specific knowledge. Over the years, the Placement Cell has experienced the visit of leading corporates, and renowned companies catering not only to placements but also to fellowships and internships. The Placement Cell of MMC works towards maximizing student welfare and helping each student attain her goal.",
