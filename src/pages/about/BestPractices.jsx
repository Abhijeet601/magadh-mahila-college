Integrating ICT into Teaching-learning Practices

Information and Communication Technology known as ICT, is a well recognized tool of satisfying the ever-lasting quest for knowledge and learning. In the current educational scenario it has become imperative to look beyond the traditional education systems in order to address the world’s growing and changing needs. Our institution has continuously responded to this emergent need to cater to the demand of appropriate technology fostering and elevated thinking, effective communication, problem solving and global competence among students. A combination of traditional and modern learning methods in the classroom incorporates both face-to-face and online learning opportunities for our students. This, together with the use of open educational resources and other technologies can increase educational productivity of the teachers by accelerating the rate of learning, reducing costs associated with instructional materials or programme delivery and better time management. MMC has state-of-the-art infrastructure and learning resources. Smart classrooms are getting popular now- a-days and the college has this so that students are benefitted. 12 class rooms are ICT enabled. While the number of new infrastructural development has increased, the number of existing classrooms and seminar halls has been upgraded with new technology supported with ICT, LCDs, K-Yans, Smart Boards, CCTV Cameras, and Wi-Fi facilities. Equipment such as laptops, web cameras, printers, projectors etc is accessible for students and is given to them according to their needs. Training for the use of ICT devices and Digital library is also provided by the college to students. This gives an edge over others when it comes to placement and higher studies. The institution has adopted the strategy of creation and enhancement of its ICT infrastructure which is continuously upgraded with the latest computing facilities. Important institutional information is disseminated through the college website and through a dedicated online platform. The staff and students have access to technology and information retrieval on current and relevant issues through the e-learning facilities. Faculty is provided with the requisite facilities for preparation of computer aided teaching – learning material. Thus they can consciously build understanding about how to use technology appropriately and meaningfully.

Environmental Consciousness and Sustainability

Magadh Mahila College is committed toward maintaining a greener and eco-friendly campus. Students and staff of the institute are educated on proper waste management practices through lectures, advertisements on notice boards, and slogan boards on the campus. Solid wastes are segregated into coloured dustbins kept for biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste throughout the campus. Bio-manure is prepared from organic solid wastes such as leaves of plants and residues from mess of campus hostels. The college promotes paperless functioning and minimal paper waste. The institute takes efforts to minimize e-waste by repairing the computer and electronic components. E-wastes are collected and stored in the storeroom.

College believes in fundamentals of energy conservation. A 100 KWp solar power plant has been installed on the roof of main building of MMC, which is providing a renewable source of energy. The solar power plant saves electricity bill of the college by about 40% every month. To conserve energy regular bulbs and tube lights have been replaced by CFL and LED lamp. They consume around 80-90% less energy and also last around 10-20 times longer. Staff and students are advised to turn off lights and fans when they are not being used.
