# Campus Life Facilities Enhancement

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add state management for selected facility
- [x] Create facility image mapping for gallery folders
- [x] Make facility cards clickable to open modal
- [x] Implement facility details modal with images
- [x] Add fallback for facilities without images

## Summary
Successfully implemented interactive facility cards in the Campus Life page. When users click on any facility card in the "World-Class Facilities" section, a modal opens displaying:
- Facility icon, title, and description
- Associated images from mapped gallery folders
- Clickable thumbnails that open full-size images
- Fallback message for facilities without images

The implementation uses existing gallery data and maintains consistent styling with the rest of the application.
